                	HadrHN-IAEA-test     

                           B. Kutsenko

This is modification to HadrHN specificly for the purpose of the test of the new photonuclear class based on IAEA model. 
The goal of this test is to identify accuracy of Geant4 elementary cross sections of the new IAEA model versus CHIPS and previous XS photonuclear models. 

Projectile: gamma
Cross sections classes: “CHIPS”, “IAEA”, “XS”
 
PDG data are from  http://pdg.lbl.gov.
Files with data are located in HadrHN/data directory. 

	        Compilation
G4BLOCAL points to directory where geant4-dev is located
HADSRC -> .../g4tests-verification/hadronic
G4BWORK points to directory where G4 executables are located (.../bin)
G4BBUILD points to build directory for geant4 (.../geant4-build-mt/)
G4VERSION ->  (10.5.0)

mkdir -p ${G4BLOCAL}/tests-build/HadrHN
cd ${G4BLOCAL}/tests-build/HadrHN
rm -f HadrHN

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${G4BLOCAL} \
      -DGeant4_DIR=${G4BBUILD}/lib64/Geant4-${G4VERSION} ${HADSRC}/HadrHN
make -j2

cd ${G4BWORK}
rm -f HadrHN
ln -s ${G4BLOCAL}/tests-build/HadrHN/HadrHN

cd ${HADSRC}/HadrHN

                Run Productuion

Simple run for gamma:
$G4BWORK/HadrHN gamma [XS/CHIPS/IAEA] [target atomic name (H)]

Simple run for gamma with isotope target on IAEA model (deuteron as an example):
$G4BWORK/HadrHN gamma ISOIAEA [ISOXS/ISOCHIPS/ISOIAEA] H [element target atomic name (H)]

Enter A: 2

		Plots

python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root 0 # Plot from 0 to 200 MeV in linear scale on x and logarithmic scale on y
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root 1 # Plot from 0 to 100 000 MeV in double log scale
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root 2 # Plot from 0 to 1.e+13 MeV in 10-based logarithmic scale on y

The same but with two model comparison :
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root gamma_proton_IAEA_1_0.root 0 # Plot from 0 to 200 MeV in linear scale on x and logarithmic scale on y
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root gamma_proton_IAEA_1_0.root 1 # Plot from 0 to 100 000 MeV in double log scale
python plotXSmodel_only.py gamma_proton_CHIPS_1_0.root gamma_proton_IAEA_1_0.root 2 # Plot from 0 to 1.e+13 MeV in 10-based logarithmic scale on y
 

Plots are creating in HadrHN/plotXS directory.
